# Analysis Validation

Every AI-generated finding must be validated before it can inform decisions. AI models can produce plausible-sounding analysis that is factually incorrect, statistically misleading, or based on flawed assumptions. Rigorous validation is not optional — it is a core AOMT discipline.

<Callout type="warning" title="Hallucination Risk">
AI models can "hallucinate" — generating confident, detailed outputs that are partially or entirely fabricated. This risk is especially high when the AI is asked to provide specific numbers, benchmarks, or industry statistics from memory. Always verify AI-generated claims against primary sources.
</Callout>

## The Validation Framework

A finding is considered a <GlossaryTerm term="Validated Gap">Validated Gap</GlossaryTerm> only when it satisfies all three validation criteria:

1. **Quantitative Validation** — The finding is supported by statistical analysis of the actual data. Results must include confidence intervals, sample sizes, and significance tests where applicable.

2. **Qualitative Validation** — The finding is confirmed by subject matter experts or stakeholders who can attest that it reflects operational reality. Data patterns without qualitative context may be artifacts or anomalies.

3. **<GlossaryTerm term="Benchmark">Benchmark</GlossaryTerm> Validation** — The finding is contextualized against relevant industry benchmarks, historical baselines, or peer comparisons. A metric is only meaningful when compared to a standard.

## Root Cause vs. Symptom

<Callout type="concept" title="Dig Deeper">
Many initial findings identify symptoms rather than root causes. A high call volume is a symptom; a confusing self-service portal that drives customers to call is a root cause. AI can help trace causal chains, but the practitioner must insist on asking "why?" at least 3-5 times before accepting a finding as a root cause.
</Callout>

## Validation Checklist

For each finding, confirm:

| Criterion | Question | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Quantitative | Is the finding statistically significant with adequate sample size? | |
| Qualitative | Have SMEs confirmed this matches operational reality? | |
| Benchmark | How does this compare to industry standards or historical baseline? | |
| Root Cause | Is this a root cause or a symptom of a deeper issue? | |
| Reproducible | Can the analysis be re-run with consistent results? | |

<Callout type="tip" title="Document Everything">
Record the validation status of every finding in a structured format. Unvalidated findings should be clearly marked as preliminary. This transparency builds stakeholder trust and prevents premature action on unverified insights.
