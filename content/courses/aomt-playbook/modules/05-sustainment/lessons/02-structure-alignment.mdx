# Structure (Alignment)

The Structure pillar ensures that the organization is aligned to sustain the AI solution through clear roles, responsibilities, accountability mechanisms, and incentive structures. Without structural alignment, even well-trained teams will revert to old behaviors under operational pressure.

## Key Questions for Structural Alignment

Before considering the solution fully deployed, answer these questions:

- **Who owns this solution?** Identify a single accountable owner (not a committee) who is responsible for ongoing performance and evolution.
- **Who operates it daily?** Define the specific roles that interact with the solution as part of their daily workflow.
- **Who monitors performance?** Assign responsibility for reviewing metrics, identifying trends, and escalating issues.
- **Who decides on changes?** Establish the decision-making authority for solution modifications, updates, and enhancements.
- **Who funds ongoing costs?** Confirm the budget allocation for hosting, maintenance, support, and future development.
- **What happens when the owner leaves?** Define the succession plan and knowledge transfer process for key roles.

## Incentive Alignment

<Callout type="concept" title="Align Incentives with Desired Behaviors">
People respond to what they are measured on. If dispatch coordinators are measured on call handling speed but the AI solution prioritizes first-visit resolution, the metrics create a conflict that the AI will lose. Ensure that individual and team performance metrics, bonus structures, and recognition programs are aligned with the outcomes the solution is designed to deliver.
</Callout>

When transitioning to AI-enabled operations, existing incentive structures often conflict with desired behaviors. Identify and update these misalignments:

| Old Incentive | Behavior It Drives | New Incentive | Desired Behavior |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Highest sales volume | Chase any sale regardless of fit | Profitable revenue growth | Pursue high-margin customers |
| Production throughput | Maximize output, ignore quality | First-pass yield rate | Balance speed with quality |
| Call handle time | Rush customers off the phone | First-call resolution | Solve problems completely |

<Callout type="warning" title="Misaligned Incentives Kill Solutions">
Without incentive alignment, teams optimize within their silos at the expense of enterprise outcomes. If variable pay and recognition are not updated to reflect new methods, employees will continue optimizing for old metrics — even when they directly contradict the intended change.
</Callout>

## Metro Cable Dispatch Analyst Example

In the Metro Cable case study, the sustainment structure was defined as follows:

| Role | Responsibility | Accountability |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| Dispatch Operations Manager | Solution owner; approves changes; reports to VP Operations | Monthly performance review with executive sponsor |
| Lead Dispatch Analyst | Daily monitoring; first-line issue resolution; coordinates with IT | Weekly metrics dashboard; escalation within 4 hours for critical issues |
| AI/ML Engineering Team | Model monitoring; retraining pipeline; technical support | Model performance SLAs; quarterly model review |
| Field Supervisors | User feedback collection; process adherence monitoring | Bi-weekly feedback summaries; adherence audit participation |

<Callout type="tip" title="Start Lean, Scale as Needed">
Do not over-engineer the sustainment structure at launch. Start with the minimum viable roles and governance, then expand as the solution matures and its operational footprint grows. A heavy governance structure on day one creates bureaucratic overhead that slows adoption.
</Callout>

<ReflectionPrompt
  question="Consider an AI tool or system currently deployed in your organization. Who is the single accountable owner? If nobody comes to mind, what does that tell you about sustainment risks?"
  answer="If you cannot identify a single accountable owner, the solution is at high risk of degradation. Without clear ownership, nobody is responsible for monitoring performance, responding to issues, or evolving the solution. The first step is always to assign a named individual (not a committee) as the accountable owner."
