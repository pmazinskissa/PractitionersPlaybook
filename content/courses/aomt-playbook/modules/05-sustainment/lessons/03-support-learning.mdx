# Support (Learning)

The Support pillar ensures that everyone who interacts with the AI solution has the knowledge, skills, and resources to use it effectively. Support is not a one-time training event — it is a continuous learning system that evolves alongside the solution.

## 5 Support Components

A comprehensive support system includes:

1. **Initial Training** — Structured onboarding for all users covering the solution's purpose, core workflows, and expected behaviors. Include hands-on practice with real (or realistic) scenarios.

2. **Reference Documentation** — Accessible, up-to-date documentation including quick-start guides, workflow diagrams, FAQ sections, and troubleshooting procedures. Documentation should be searchable and versioned.

3. **Ongoing Learning** — Regular refresher sessions, advanced training for power users, and update briefings when the solution evolves. Use microlearning formats (5-10 minute modules) for continuous skill building.

4. **Help Desk and Escalation** — A clear path for users to get help when they encounter issues. Define first-line support (team leads), second-line support (solution analysts), and third-line support (technical teams) with response time expectations.

5. **Knowledge Community** — A forum or channel where users can share tips, ask questions, and learn from each other's experiences. Peer learning is often more effective than formal training for practical problem-solving.

<Callout type="tip" title="AI-Powered Support">
Use AI to enhance the support system itself. An AI-powered help assistant can answer common user questions instantly, provide contextual guidance within the solution interface, and escalate complex issues to human support with full context. This reduces the support burden on the team while improving user experience.

<Callout type="warning" title="Training Is Not a One-Time Event">
The most common sustainment failure is treating training as a checkbox completed at launch. Staff turnover means new users join continuously. Solution updates change workflows. Operational context evolves. Training must be an ongoing program with regular refreshers, updated materials, and mechanisms to assess competency over time.

## Measuring Support Effectiveness

Track these indicators to assess whether the support system is working:

| Indicator | Target | Red Flag |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Help desk ticket volume | Declining over time | Sustained or increasing volume after initial ramp-down |
| Time to resolve user issues | Decreasing as knowledge builds | Persistent long resolution times indicate knowledge gaps |
| Feature adoption rate | Increasing as users gain confidence | Stagnant adoption suggests training or UX issues |
| User satisfaction scores | Stable or improving | Declining satisfaction may signal unmet support needs |
| Self-service resolution rate | Increasing over time | Low self-service suggests documentation gaps |
