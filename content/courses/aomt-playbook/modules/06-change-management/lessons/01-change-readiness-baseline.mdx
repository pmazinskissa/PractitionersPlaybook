# Change Readiness Baseline

Before launching any organizational change initiative, practitioners must establish a <GlossaryTerm term="Readiness Baseline">Readiness Baseline</GlossaryTerm> — a structured assessment of the organization's current capacity to absorb and sustain the proposed changes. The baseline does not determine whether change should happen; it determines how the change approach should be designed.

## Three Dimensions of Readiness

<ProcessFlow steps={[
  { title: "North Star Vision", description: "Does the organization have a clear, compelling vision for the future state? Is leadership aligned on the direction? Can the vision be articulated simply enough that frontline workers understand their role in achieving it?" },
  { title: "Performance Management", description: "Are the existing performance management systems capable of measuring the new behaviors and outcomes required? Can metrics be adapted to reward adoption and surface resistance? Is there a baseline of current performance to measure against?" },
  { title: "Resource Availability", description: "Does the organization have the budget, people, technology, and time to implement the change alongside ongoing operations? Are key resources already committed to competing priorities?" }
]} />

<Callout type="concept" title="Not Pass/Fail">
The Readiness Baseline is a diagnostic tool, not a gate. A low readiness score does not mean the change should be abandoned — it means the change approach must be designed to address specific readiness gaps. An organization with weak performance management systems needs a change plan that includes building those systems. An organization with strong vision alignment but limited resources needs a phased approach that manages workload.
</Callout>

## Assessing Each Dimension

For each dimension, evaluate on a 5-point scale:

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Not Present | No evidence of this capability; must be built from scratch |
| 2 | Emerging | Early-stage efforts exist but are inconsistent and informal |
| 3 | Developing | Structured approaches exist but are not yet fully embedded |
| 4 | Established | Robust, consistent capability that is well-understood across the organization |
| 5 | Optimized | Best-in-class capability that is continuously improved and leveraged strategically |

<Callout type="warning" title="Resource Reality Check">
Resource availability is the most commonly overestimated dimension. Organizations routinely commit to transformation initiatives without honestly assessing whether their people have the capacity to take on additional work. Be rigorous in this assessment — survey actual team workloads, not what managers think the workload should be.
</Callout>

## Using the Baseline

The baseline directly informs the change management plan. Dimensions scoring 1-2 require dedicated workstreams in the change plan. Dimensions scoring 3-4 require monitoring and reinforcement. Dimensions scoring 5 can be leveraged as strengths to accelerate other aspects of the change.
