# Governance Framework

Governance provides the decision-making structures and accountability mechanisms that keep the transformation on track. A well-designed governance framework balances oversight with agility, ensuring that decisions are made quickly by the right people with the right information.

## 4 Governance Components

<ProcessFlow steps={[
  { title: "Steering Committee", description: "Executive-level body that sets strategic direction, removes organizational barriers, approves major scope changes, and ensures alignment with enterprise objectives. Meets monthly or as needed for critical decisions." },
  { title: "Working Group", description: "Cross-functional operational team that manages day-to-day execution, resolves tactical issues, coordinates across workstreams, and reports progress to the Steering Committee. Meets weekly." },
  { title: "Change Champions", description: "A network of embedded advocates across the affected organization who provide peer support, gather ground-level feedback, and serve as the human face of the change in their teams. Meets bi-weekly for coordination and updates." },
  { title: "Feedback Council", description: "A representative group of end users who provide structured input on solution design, training effectiveness, and adoption barriers. Serves as the voice of the frontline in governance decisions. Meets bi-weekly, rotating membership to maintain fresh perspectives." }

<Callout type="concept" title="Governance Is Not Bureaucracy">
Governance should enable speed, not impede it. If governance meetings become status updates without decisions, if approval processes create bottlenecks that delay execution by weeks, or if governance artifacts become ends in themselves rather than tools for clarity — the framework needs to be simplified. Every governance activity should answer the question: "Does this help us make better decisions faster?"
</Callout>

## Meeting Cadence

| Body | Frequency | Duration | Key Agenda Items |
|------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Steering Committee | Monthly | 60 min | Strategic alignment review, barrier removal, major decision approval |
| Working Group | Weekly | 45 min | Execution status, issue resolution, cross-workstream coordination |
| Change Champions | Bi-weekly | 30 min | Feedback summary, adoption insights, upcoming communications preview |
| Feedback Council | Bi-weekly | 45 min | User experience feedback, training gaps, solution improvement suggestions |

<Callout type="tip" title="Governance Evolution">
The governance framework should evolve as the transformation progresses. Early stages require more frequent Steering Committee engagement and heavier Working Group coordination. As the change stabilizes, governance can shift toward lighter-touch monitoring with the Feedback Council and Change Champions playing a larger role. Plan for governance to scale down, not just up.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Avoid Single Points of Failure">
If the entire governance framework depends on one person (typically the program manager or change lead), the transformation is fragile. Ensure that at least two people can chair each governance body, that meeting notes and decisions are documented in a shared location, and that the governance framework survives personnel changes without disruption.
</Callout>

## Governance Decision Rights

Document explicit decision rights for each governance body. Clarify which decisions each body can make autonomously, which require escalation, and what the escalation path looks like. This prevents both decision paralysis (everyone waiting for someone else to decide) and rogue decisions (individuals acting without appropriate authority).
