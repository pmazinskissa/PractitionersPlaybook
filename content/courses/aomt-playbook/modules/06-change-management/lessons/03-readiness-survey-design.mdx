# Readiness Survey Design

A well-designed readiness survey quantifies the qualitative dimensions identified in the baseline and assessment. It provides measurable data that can be tracked over time and compared across organizational units. Survey design requires careful attention to question construction, administration, and analysis.

## 5 Design Principles

1. **Keep it short** — Target 15-20 questions maximum. Survey fatigue degrades response quality. Every question should map to a specific readiness dimension and inform a specific decision.

2. **Use consistent scales** — Apply the same response scale (e.g., 5-point Likert from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree) across all questions. This enables cross-question comparison and index construction.

3. **Balance quantitative and qualitative** — Include 2-3 open-ended questions alongside scaled items. Open-ended responses often reveal issues that structured questions miss.

4. **Segment by audience** — Design the survey so that results can be analyzed by department, role, tenure, and location. Aggregate scores can mask significant variation across groups.

5. **Establish a baseline** — Administer the survey before the change begins, then repeat at regular intervals (typically every 60-90 days) to track readiness trajectory over time.

## Sample Question Categories

| Category | Example Question | Readiness Dimension |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Awareness | "I understand why our organization is implementing this change" | Case for Change |
| Capability | "I feel confident that I have the skills needed to work with the new system" | Support/Learning |
| Willingness | "I believe this change will improve how I do my work" | Influence/Adoption |
| Leadership | "My direct manager actively supports and communicates about this change" | Structure/Alignment |

<Callout type="tip" title="AI-Assisted Analysis">
Use AI to analyze open-ended survey responses at scale. AI can categorize themes, identify sentiment patterns, and surface specific concerns that would take hours to extract manually. This transforms qualitative survey data from anecdotal evidence into structured, actionable intelligence.

<Callout type="warning" title="Guarantee Anonymity">
Readiness surveys are only valuable if respondents answer honestly. Guarantee anonymity in both the survey design (no identifying information required) and the reporting (results reported only at the group level, never individual). If employees fear their responses will be attributed to them, the survey will measure what people think leadership wants to hear, not what they actually believe.

## Acting on Survey Results

Survey results should drive specific actions, not just reports. For each readiness dimension that scores below the target threshold, define a specific intervention: additional communication, targeted training, leadership engagement, or resource reallocation. Track whether interventions improve scores in subsequent survey waves.
